on github.com
-------------

* log into `github.com` using your personal GitHub account
* go to [the xpca project page](https://github.com/pvdb/xpca)

* you will now have a cloned version of the `xpca` project on GitHub
* go to your `https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/xpca` project page

As a one-off, clone _your_ version of the `xpca` project, and add _my_ version as one of its remotes:

    cd ~/Workarea # or any other directory where you keep your projects...
    git clone git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/xpca.git
    cd xpca
    git remote add upstream git://github.com/pvdb/xpca.git

Then, going forward, you can fetch and merge the latest changes from the main `xpca` project as follows:

    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/master

getting started
---------------

    gem install bundler
    bundle install --system
